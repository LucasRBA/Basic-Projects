# This project was inspired by the following challenge [Calculator Challenge](https://github.com/digitalinnovationone/trilha-react-desafio01-calculadora) from DIO

### It was proposed by [pablohdev](https://github.com/pablohdev) during the React Course created in partnership with [Digital Innovation One](https://web.dio.me/)

### In addition to the calculator functionality, I learned about the react-router-dom creating a Unit Converter that was basically a fork from this project from user [Karthikeyan Ranasthala](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/github/KarthikeyanRanasthala/react-unit-converter/tree/master/?file=%2Fsrc%2Fcomponents%2FInputField.js%3A15%2C30)

### This was also developed, ran and debugged using [Bun](https://bun.sh/), in order to run a project with using bun you may need to follow the documentation in the link above and execute it with `bun run start`



# Below are instructions generated automatically by the `create-react-app` command.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` or 

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
